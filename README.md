# Quantum Password Generator

## Overview
This project implements a **quantum-inspired password generator** with multiple security layers to produce strong and unique passwords. It includes:
- Entropy-based core generation
- Advanced bitwise rotation
- Dynamic substitution system
- Multi-key XOR encryption
- Hybrid hashing function
- Adaptive morph system
- Quantum finalization techniques

### Example:
Run the program to get quantum-secure passwords like this:
```bash
Quantum-secure password: Z#!9kL8^t$BPx7_Z3
```
## Installation
To run the code, you need:
1. **C++ Compiler**:
   - Install **GCC** for Linux/Mac via terminal:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install g++ # On Ubuntu
     ```
   - Use **Visual Studio** for Windows and set up C++ development tools.
   
2. Save the code as `quantum_password_generator.cpp`.

## Execution
```bash
g++ -o quantum_password quantum_password_generator.cpp
./quantum_password
```
Or simply compile and run on your favorite IDE!

## Security Features
Each layer adds protection using techniques such as chaos pattern injection and quantum-inspired encryption.
